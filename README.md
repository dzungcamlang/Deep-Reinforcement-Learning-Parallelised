# Massively Parallel Methods for Deep Reinforcement Learning

In this project, we implement a parralelized DQN on CPU, as presented in the paper :  [Massively Parallel Methods for Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.04296)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need Python 3.5 and the numpy library.

### Running the simulations

You can change the simulation parameters under the parameters file.

Then simply run the main.py

```
python3 main.py
```
